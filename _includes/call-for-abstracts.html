The focus of the workshop is on methodology, via contributed talks, invited talks and discussion on different research experiences. To this end, we invite the submission of abstracts describing research methodologies that may be broadly useful and generalizable.  As the goal of this research is to build on work the community has already done, these methodologies may have already been published elsewhere. Speakers should focus on the methodology rather than the results the obtained with it. They should address the range of systems that their method may generalize  to, as well as its limitations. Methods that may be applicable beyond ALife are of particular interest. Additionally, we encourage presenters to emphasize best practices to be aware of when using their methods. In this porting, we connect the participant ALife researchers with different topics of work, to share their experience when designing and running ALife experiments, while focusing on key aspects that are relevant for research on different ALife topics. Each talk will be followed by a whole-group discussion on potential further applications of the methodology . Notes from talks and discussions will be posted on the internet as a resource for the field.
